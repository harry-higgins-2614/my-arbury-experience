      <h1 class="intro-title">My Arbury Experience</h1>
      <p>In February 2024, I purchased a used Vauxhall Zafira Tourer from Arbury Motor Group in Walsall. Alongside the vehicle, I was sold an extended warranty (SPOTiCAR Extended Warranty), which was presented as offering peace of mind for unexpected major repair costs.</p>
      <p>This website documents my journey — from significant mechanical issues and poor communication to my efforts to find a fair resolution.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="summary">
      <h1>Summary of Issues</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Car delivery was delayed unexpectedly, causing inconvenience and additional travel costs.</li>
        <li>Vehicle was delivered with visible damage that was initially denied by the salesperson.</li>
        <li>Mechanical faults appeared within 12 months, including a critical timing chain issue.</li>
        <li>Car became undrivable and broke down in traffic, requiring police intervention.</li>
        <li>Arbury and SPOTiCAR have not provided adequate support to resolve the issue under warranty.</li>
        <li>Customer has been left without a usable vehicle since March 2025.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="timeline">
      <h2>Timeline of Mechanical Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>20 Feb 2025:</strong> Vehicle fails MOT at Arbury due to engine light. Returned to me with light off.</li>
        <li><strong>22 Feb 2025:</strong> Vehicle passes MOT at a different garage.</li>
        <li><strong>Late Feb – March 2025:</strong> Engine light intermittently returns. I limit use and arrange a diagnostic.</li>
        <li><strong>20 Mar 2025:</strong> Independent diagnostic reveals timing chain and clutch issues. Advised vehicle is unsafe to drive.</li>
        <li><strong>29 Mar 2025:</strong> Vehicle breaks down after a hospital appointment. Police attend. Recovery via friend&rsquo;s service.</li>
        <li><strong>10 Apr 2025:</strong> Contacted Arbury to initiate warranty support.</li>
        <li><strong>April–May 2025:</strong> Car remains undrivable. Ongoing delays, limited support offered, recovery and diagnostics still not fully covered.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="concerns">
      <h2>Concerns Raised</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of meaningful communication for weeks despite a serious issue.</li>
        <li>No support offered for vehicle recovery despite the car being undrivable.</li>
        <li>Potential for high diagnostic costs — even though I&rsquo;ve already paid for a third-party diagnostic.</li>
        <li>Warranty sold as peace of mind but now creating financial uncertainty before support is even confirmed.</li>
        <li>Early sales process raised red flags, including unexplained delivery damage and resistance to resolving it.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ask">
      <h2>What I&rsquo;m Asking For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>That Arbury covers the cost of recovery, or arranges it without charge, given the condition and circumstances.</li>
        <li>That no diagnostic charges are passed to me, whether the repair is deemed valid under warranty or not.</li>
        <li>That the full cost of any repair related to this fault is covered either under the warranty or by Arbury — I do not believe it is fair or acceptable for me to bear any repair costs in these circumstances.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
