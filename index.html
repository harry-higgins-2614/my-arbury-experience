    <h1>My Experience with Arbury Motor Group</h1>
    <p>A personal account of a vehicle purchase and warranty issue involving a Vauxhall Zafira Tourer (Reg: ML18 FWP)</p>
    <p>The following account can be interpreted as my review of Arbury.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In February 2024, I purchased a used Vauxhall Zafira Tourer from Arbury Motor Group in Walsall. Alongside the vehicle, I was sold an extended warranty (SPOTiCAR Extended Warranty), which was presented as offering peace of mind for unexpected major repair costs.

      <p>
        This website documents my experience since that purchase — including significant mechanical issues, poor communication, and my attempts to resolve the situation fairly through Arbury.

      <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>February 2024:</strong> Vehicle purchased from Arbury Walsall with SPOTiCAR Extended Warranty. Mileage at purchase: 59,050.</li>
        <li><strong>April 2025:</strong> Engine Management Light appears. Car begins stalling from neutral and running rough. Garage advises it is unsafe to drive and diagnoses suspected timing chain and clutch issues (~£2,100).</li>
        <li><strong>10 April 2025:</strong> I contact Arbury to begin the warranty process.</li>
        <li><strong>14 April – 30 April 2025:</strong> Multiple follow-ups with little to no response.</li>
        <li><strong>May 2025:</strong> Arbury advises they can look at the car but will not cover recovery. I am informed diagnostics are free for up to one hour only — any further time will be chargeable at a rate of £180/hr.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Concerns Raised</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of meaningful communication for weeks despite a serious issue.</li>
        <li>No support offered for vehicle recovery despite the car being undrivable.</li>
        <li>Potential for high diagnostic costs — even though I’ve already paid for a third-party diagnostic.</li>
        <li>Warranty sold as peace of mind but now creating financial uncertainty before support is even confirmed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What I’m Asking For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>That Arbury covers the cost of recovery, or arranges it without charge, given the condition and circumstances.</li>
        <li>That no diagnostic charges are passed to me, whether the repair is deemed valid under warranty or not.</li>
      </ul>
