      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In February 2024, I purchased a used Vauxhall Zafira Tourer from Arbury Motor Group in Walsall. Alongside the vehicle, I was sold an extended warranty (SPOTiCAR Extended Warranty), which was presented as offering peace of mind for unexpected major repair costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website documents my experience since that purchase — including significant mechanical issues, poor communication, and my attempts to resolve the situation fairly through Arbury.

      <h2>Buying Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>February 2024:</strong> I arrived to collect the car but was told it wasn’t ready. The vehicle was eventually delivered to me a week later, resulting in lost time, additional fuel costs, and frustration.</li>
        <li><strong>February 2024 (Delivery Day):</strong> Upon delivery, I was not asked to inspect the vehicle. The following morning, I discovered a muddy scrape on the rear driver’s side bumper after moving the car only a few feet. The salesperson initially denied responsibility, suggesting it was a bicycle, despite no evidence. The repair was only agreed to after I requested to escalate the matter to the Sales Manager.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Timeline of Mechanical Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>20 Feb 2025:</strong> Vehicle fails MOT at Arbury due to engine light. Returned to me with light off.</li>
        <li><strong>22 Feb 2025:</strong> Vehicle passes MOT at a different garage.</li>
        <li><strong>Late Feb – March 2025:</strong> Engine light intermittently returns. I limit use and arrange a diagnostic.</li>
        <li><strong>20 Mar 2025:</strong> Independent diagnostic reveals timing chain and clutch issues. Advised vehicle is unsafe to drive.</li>
        <li><strong>29 Mar 2025:</strong> Vehicle breaks down after a hospital appointment. Police attend. Recovery via friend’s service.</li>
        <li><strong>10 Apr 2025:</strong> Contacted Arbury to initiate warranty support.</li>
        <li><strong>April–May 2025:</strong> Car remains undrivable. Ongoing delays, limited support offered, recovery and diagnostics still not fully covered.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Concerns Raised</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of meaningful communication for weeks despite a serious issue.</li>
        <li>No support offered for vehicle recovery despite the car being undrivable.</li>
        <li>Potential for high diagnostic costs — even though I’ve already paid for a third-party diagnostic.</li>
        <li>Warranty sold as peace of mind but now creating financial uncertainty before support is even confirmed.</li>
        <li>Early sales process raised red flags, including unexplained delivery damage and resistance to resolving it.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

<section>
  <h2>What I’m Asking For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>That Arbury covers the cost of recovery, or arranges it without charge, given the condition and circumstances.</li>
    <li>That no diagnostic charges are passed to me, whether the repair is deemed valid under warranty or not.</li>
    <li>That the full cost of any repair related to this fault is covered either under the warranty or by Arbury — I do not believe it is fair or acceptable for me to bear any repair costs in these circumstances.</li>
  </ul>
